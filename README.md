Clone the repo and install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Run the notebook (you need `jupyter` for it) with `jupyter notebook <object-of-interest>.ipynb`.

You can also execute the .py file, if you don't need or want to run the jupyter environment.

You can also visualise the notebooks with the nbviewer [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ivandga/ArasSpectraNotebooks/).
